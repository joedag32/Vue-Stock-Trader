# Vue Stock Trader

A very basic stock trading app built using Vue.js. This was the final assignment in the VueJS 2 The Complete Guide course that I have been following on Udemy. It was a great course if you are looking to learn more about Vue.js.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
